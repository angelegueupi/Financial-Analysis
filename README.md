# pybank 
This project is subdivide in 2 parts. The first challenge called pybank my task was to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company base on a data called [budget_data.csv].

My goal was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Final financial analisis report

--------------------------
averageprofitlosses= $-8311.11
--------------------------
greatestprofitincrease= 16-Aug, $1862002
--------------------------
greatestprofitdecrease= 14-Feb,$-1825558

This second part of the challenge called Pypoll, my task was to modernize vote counting processs of a small, rural town. base on a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv
