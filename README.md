# pythonchallenge
This challenge is subdivide in 2 parts. The first challenge called pybank my task was to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of the company base on a data called [budget_data.csv].

My goal was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Final financial analisis report
